### **Design Choices**
I looked through the  website [coolors](https://coolors.co/) but i couldn't settle on a pallet that would suit the band so i have spent time looking through colours using the dev tools until i found what i felt reprisented the bands vibe while still providing suitable contrast to buttons, backgrounds and content.

<a></a>
#### Fonts
I have used Google fonts to find the desired font styles from this project and have decided font-family: 'Passions Conflict' works best for the bands home page name title as it fits with a previous font style used that band has been using for years that their followers would recognise, but i feel this has an additional level of elegance.
For headings and content i have taken a more simplified clean cut approach to the font styles as being able to read the content clearly and easily is far more important for user experience than flmaboiance.
I have done a bit of reasearch into the most popular fonts and why on google and have come to the conclusion that font-family: 'Lato' would work great for the content as it's very clean but has slight smooth cut charactaristics that i found interesting and drew me in.
I paired font-family: 'Lora' with Lato for my headings, i read this was a popular choice and i'm happy with the results as it clearly stands apart from the content font type producing a punchy cleary heading that in a distant way alos ties into the font type used for the bands name on the main home page.


<a></a>
#### Icons
I have decided to implement icons, using the [Font Awesome library](https://fontawesome.com/ "Font Awesome"). I have used a minimalalistic aproach to icons on my website, I've used them for the purpose of social media links and nothing else as i beleive this is their main purpose in this design.

<a></a>
#### Colors
The colours i have used for the website are as follows;

* #a58869 = This is my main background colour as i feel it represents a natural wooden colour whilts not drawing you away from the foreground which i want the use to concentrate on.
* #8b8a91 = I have chosen to use this grey for my header and footer it's subtle and follows suit with the theme of using greys throughout the website and the band also tend to like black and white photography over colour, so i felt this taylors to their general preferences.
* #bb6707 = This orange was chosen for buttons & social media links for two key reasons, firstly the band have enjoyed using orange on their promotional flyers in the past so this falls in line both what they like but also what their followers expect/feel they should be seeing and secondly it also provides a beautiful striking contrast to stand out, getting users to subscribe, contact them and view further content via their social media outlets.
* rgba(79, 80, 85, 0.575)
  rgba(0,0,0,0.5)
  rgba(37, 38, 44, 0.877) = I have used a few different shades of translucent grey to provide contrast to some of my content fields where i felt is was required. I didn't want to lose the background image behind the content enterly but also didn't want the background image to draw the user way from the content i want them to see.
* #d6d6d6 = This off white make the pefect colour for content as it won't be too harsh on the eyes for user's when reading larger blocks of text.
* #fffffb = This is a bright white that will be used in areas when i want text to be striking and really stand out from it's background such as certain header and the live events table.


<a></a>
#### Structure
I have decided to use [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) to build the base structure of my website as it has proven to be an invaluable framework. 
Bootstrap provides various elements of CSS and Javascript which is very helpful to keep a good structure on my pages. 
As Bootstrap is designed for mobile first, I will be certain that my website functions well on mobile.

## **Wireframes**
Upon a discussion with my mentor [Balsamic](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/) is what i have decideed to use for designing the wireframes for my project.
I started with a mobile first aproach, so designed the website for mobile devices first, moving to tablets next and finally creating the desktop design.
I have a four page design which i believe will be the best approach in order to seperate content as it would be too much for one page. This will ensure that the website is easy to read and navigate


You can find my wireframes below:

## **Features**
<a></a>
### **Existing Features**

#### Navigation
I have used Bootstrap to create my navbar due to it's responsive nature between devices sizes.
For mobile devices i have used a dropdown menu which is a lot cleaner than trying to squeeze all options onto a small navbar.



#### Home Page - Hero Image

I have decided to implement a hero image which spreads over 100% width of the screen. I have set the height at 80vh to show a little of what comes next to entise the user into scrolling down the page.
The image responds well when viewing on desktop, tablet and mobile.


#### About Us Section

Here I used the grid from Bootstrap to create 3 colums on desktop & tablet view which turn into full width stacked columns on mobile devices. To help separate the columns i will provide a dark translucent boxes to each field. 

#### Live Events Section

For the live events section i will use a responsive background image of the band playing live that will fill the screen on all devices sizes. 

I will implement a table to nest all upcoming event dates, locations and times whilst each location will also be a link to the venues websites for eas of users to be able to contact said venue to enquire to booking tickets to see the band play. This table will be responsive to all device sizes and have a width of 50% to not tke up the screens real-estate as the back ground will also help to represent what an event setting could look like.

#### Gallery Section

For the gallery images i have decided to use a bootstrap carosel slide show as i felt a gallery with lots of images across the section would take away from the website clean and easy to view look. 

I decided against filling the screen width for the carosel as i wanted it to taper into the bands main content for the section, their live studio recording which is in the form of a youtube embeded video spaning a 100% width of the page on all device sizes as it's the main focal point of the section and something the band want to be prominant on the website to help encourage users to book them.


#### Contact Us Section

In the contact-us section i have made the following filed manditory to complete Name, Email, Enquiry Description, I have chosen to leave the phone number as non-complusory as most users do not like to provide phone numbers upon making enquiries as a whole so doing this should help to build the level of enquiries the band recieve.

In the event and enquiry details section I have used some decriptive place holder text to help guide the user into what they would need to let tyhe band know what they want for booking, this will help the band with returning a comprehensive reply.
